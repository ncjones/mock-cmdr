# Goal

Type hints for the stub/find definitions and invocations.

# Ideas

## Idea #1

Assessment: Inadequate

Type hints are probably achievable in client codebases without any changes to
mock-cmdr by using typescript `declare` statements. The drawbacks with this
approach are:

 * clients need to declare the stub/find commands twice (once as
   javascript functions and again as typescript declarations).
 * there's still no type hints within the javascript declaration.


## Idea #2

Assessment: Feasible

Allow stub/find functions to be declared staticly instead of dynamically so
that typescript typehints work everywhere. This will require changing mock-cmdr
so that commands can be instantiated directly by clients.

export const stubMyCommand = mockCmdr.defineStubCommand(function(args) {
  const mapping: WiremockStubMapping = {
    //...
  };
  return mapping;
});

// mock/foo/index.ts
import { stubMyCommand } from './stubMyCommand';
import { findMyCommand } from './findMyCommand';
export const foo = {
  stubMyCommand,
  findMyCommand,
});


// mock/index.ts
import { foo } from './foo';
export const mocks = {
  foo,
}
